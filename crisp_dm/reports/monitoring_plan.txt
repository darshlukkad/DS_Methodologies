1. MODEL PERFORMANCE MONITORING (Weekly)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Metrics to Track:
   • SMAPE, WAPE, RMSE, MAE (compare to baseline)
   • Performance by Store Type, Department, Holiday period
   • Prediction confidence intervals (% within bounds)

   Alert Thresholds:
   ⚠️  SMAPE increases by >10% from baseline → Investigate model drift
   ⚠️  >5% of predictions outside confidence intervals → Retrain model
   ⚠️  Holiday week SMAPE >30% → Add more holiday features

   Tools: MLflow for metric tracking, Evidently for drift detection

2. DATA DRIFT MONITORING (Daily)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Feature Distribution Checks:
   • Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for continuous features (Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI)
   • Chi-square test for categorical features (Store Type)
   • Statistical distance metrics (KL-divergence, PSI)

   Alert Thresholds:
   ⚠️  KS test p < 0.05 → Significant distribution shift detected
   ⚠️  PSI > 0.2 → Moderate drift, monitor closely
   ⚠️  PSI > 0.3 → Severe drift, retrain immediately

   Tools: Evidently AI, custom drift detection scripts

3. PREDICTION QUALITY MONITORING (Real-time)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Real-time Checks:
   • Flag predictions >3 standard deviations from training mean
   • Check for missing features in production data
   • Validate input data ranges (Temperature: -20 to 120°F, etc.)
   • Monitor API latency (p50, p95, p99)

   Alert Thresholds:
   ⚠️  >1% of predictions flagged as anomalies → Investigate data quality
   ⚠️  API latency p95 > 500ms → Scale infrastructure
   ⚠️  >5 missing feature errors/hour → Fix data pipeline

   Tools: API logs, Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

4. MODEL RETRAINING SCHEDULE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Regular Retraining:
   • Quarterly (every 13 weeks) - Scheduled retraining with latest data
   • After major events - Holiday seasons, store openings/closures
   • Drift-triggered - When PSI > 0.3 or SMAPE increases by >15%

   Retraining Process:
   1. Pull latest 2 years of data from production database
   2. Re-run feature engineering pipeline (leakage-safe)
   3. Train on same architecture + hyperparameters
   4. Validate on most recent 8 weeks (hold-out validation)
   5. A/B test new model vs current model (2 weeks, 10% traffic)
   6. Deploy if new model SMAPE < current model SMAPE

   Tools: MLflow for experiment tracking, Airflow for orchestration

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Severity Levels:

   P0 (Critical - Respond in 15 min):
   • API completely down (health check failing)
   • >50% of predictions failing validation
   • Security breach or data leak
   → Rollback to previous model version immediately

   P1 (High - Respond in 2 hours):
   • SMAPE >30% increase from baseline
   • Severe data drift (PSI > 0.3)
   • API latency p95 > 2 seconds
   → Investigate root cause, prepare hotfix

   P2 (Medium - Respond in 1 day):
   • Moderate drift (PSI 0.2-0.3)
   • SMAPE 15-30% increase
   • Feature importance shift >20%
   → Schedule retraining, monitor closely

   P3 (Low - Respond in 1 week):
   • Minor drift (PSI < 0.2)
   • SMAPE 5-15% increase
   • Documentation updates needed
   → Add to backlog for next sprint

6. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP
